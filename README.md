Manifesto of Of Edinburgh University

Of Edinburgh University is an alternative university inside University of Edinburgh.

Weâ€™re based on open source philosophy. We deliver courses on unsustainability, unethical investments.
We will held conferences that will publish freely and openly while encouraging participation from non-academia.
Our first topic for discussion will be focused on unethical investments by Edinburgh University.


Business model:
The lecturing will be initially voluntarily by people and will be continued and branched by individuals in different directions. It will be backed through the publication of its paper and donations.
